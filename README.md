# 🎯 NAME USING LOOP – Written in C

While everyone at home calls me **Yash**, I figured — why not **loop it out** in C, with some **OP music** fueling the fun? 🎧🔥

This is a fun little side project where I used nested loops and conditionals to print the name **"YASH"** in the terminal — because why not turn your nickname into ASCII art?

## 🧠 What's Inside?

A C program that prints the word **YASH** using only:
- `for` loops
- `if` conditions
- and ✨ a sprinkle of logic ✨

Perfect for:
- Practicing nested loops
- Understanding pattern-based logic
- Having fun with code (seriously)
